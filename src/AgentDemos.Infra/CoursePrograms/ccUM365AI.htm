	<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
	<p>
		AI Builder is a user-friendly tool that allows you to easily create custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to automate processes, 
		gain insights, and improve decision-making. 
		It is designed to be accessible to users without extensive technical expertise, and integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft products like Power Apps and Power Automate. 
		
		
		In this course, you will learn how to train and use AI models and integrate these with your own Power Apps or Power Automate flows.
	</p>
	<p>
		Microsoft Syntex integrates AI in SharePoint. You will learn how to extract information and insights from unstructured data and documents by using the Microsoft Syntex capabilities.


	</p>
	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p>
		This course is targeted at IT Professionals and Business users with usage knowledge of Power Apps, Power
		Automate and SharePoint. They want to learn how to extend the functionalities in the Power Platform &amp;
		SharePoint
		with the help of Artificial Intelligence.
	</p>
	<h2>Course Outline</h2>
	<h4>What is Artificial Intelligence</h4>
	<p>
		Artificial Intelligence or AI is a term frequently used and overused. This brief introduction will give you an
		idea
		what AI is and how it can help your organization with recurring business problems.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What is AI?</li>
		<li>How to use AI Efficiently</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Introducing AI Builder in Power Platform</h4>
	<p>
		AI Builder is a central service that can be used throughout the Power Platform. This module introduces the Power
		Platform and the AI Builder tool to embed AI into your Power Apps and Power Automate flows.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What is AI Builder</li>
		<li>Introducing the Power Platform</li>
		<li>Licensing Requirements for AI Builder</li>
		<li>AI Builder Custom and Prebuilt Models</li>
		<li>LAB: Setup a Trial Environment for AI Builder </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Text-based Models and Prompts</h4>
	<p>
		Before we can use AI models, we first need to train them. This module covers how to prepare data and how to train Text-based AI models and reusable prompts.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Discovering Text-based AI Models: Text Translation, Entity Extraction...</li>
		<li>Microsoft Dataverse Overview</li>
		<li>Loading data in Microsoft Dataverse Tables</li>
		<li>Training Text-based Models</li>
		<li>Prepare Reusable Prompts</li>
		<li>LAB: Prepare and train two text-based AI models</li>

	</ul>



	<h4>Using AI Models in Power Platform</h4>
	<p>
		Creating and training your models is one thing, implementing them correctly is another.
		You need to build Power Apps Canvas Apps or Power Automate flows so your models can flourish.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>AI Builder in Power Automate</li>
		<li>AI Builder as Canvas Apps Controls</li>
		<li>AI Builder and Power FX</li>
		<li>LAB: Automatically classify emails by using AI</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Prediction Models</h4>
	<p>
		Microsoft Dataverse is a key tool within the Power Platform for makers. Data stored in Dataverse can be processed to predict hard-to-measure or time-critical data. Using AI, we can analyze this information and predict metadata effectively.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Training a Prediction Model with Structured Data</li>
		<li>Predicting Future Outcomes</li>
		<li>Using Model Results Throughout Microsoft 365</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Image Detection Models</h4>
	<p>
		By training your own AI Models on predefined data, you can allow processes to automatically
		classify images or even detect your organization-specific objects in these images.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Classifying vs Detecting Models</li>
		<li>Training Image Models</li>
		<li>Using Image Detection Models in Microsoft 365</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Document-Based Models</h4>
	<p>
		Every day, invoices, receipts, IDs, and a bunch of other documents need to be processed and stored in your
		company.
		With document-based AI models, you can process these in an automated way and store the extracted data wherever
		you
		like.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Document Processing Models Overview</li>
		<li>Collecting Data and Training Document-based Models</li>
		<li>Using Models in Apps or Flows</li>
		<li>Using Document Automation Solutions</li>
		<li>LAB: Train and use AI models to process invoices and agreements. </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Managing AI Builder Models</h4>
	<p>
		Your custom trained models always have room for improvement. In this module, you will learn how you can manage
		your
		custom models, retrain them, or even share them with your colleagues or others. You will also learn how to add
		security to your models.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mange, Retrain and Publish Models</li>
		<li>Share and Distribute your Model</li>
		<li>Continuously Improve your Model</li>
		<li>Secure your AI Models with Role Based Security</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>AI in SharePoint with Microsoft Syntex</h4>
	<p>
		Microsoft Syntex is a content understanding and processing service that uses AI to find and organize your
		documents. Rather than manually uploading hundreds of documents and extracting metadata manually, Microsoft
		Syntex can automate that process for you.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Microsoft Syntex Introduction</li>
		<li>Licensing</li>
		<li>Microsoft Syntex Setup</li>
		<li>Document Processing in SharePoint</li>
		<li>Content Compliance with Microsoft Syntex</li>
		<li>File Generation using Content Assembly</li>
		<li>eSignature, OCR and Image Tagging</li>
		<li>Document Translation and other Syntex features</li>
		<li>LAB: Automate contract processing using custom Syntex models</li>
		
	</ul>
