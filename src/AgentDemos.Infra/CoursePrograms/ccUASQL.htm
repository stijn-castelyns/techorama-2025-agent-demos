    <h4>Elastic Databases and Pools</h4>
    <p>
        A common application pattern in building SaaS applications is to provision a single database for each customer. 
        But different customers often have varying usage patterns making it difficult to predict the resource requirements for each individual database. 
        Elastic Database Pools solve this problem by allowing you to purchase resources for a pool of databases. 
        Within a Database Pool, each database can then request resources between specified minimum and maximum parameters.
