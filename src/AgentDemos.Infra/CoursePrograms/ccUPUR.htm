  <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  <p>

    Microsoft Purview is a powerful data governance tool that helps organizations manage and understand their data
    across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments.
    This course teaches you how to set up and configure the Data Catalog and the Data Map in Microsoft Purview, how to
    create and manage metadata, data classifications, and how to implement data discovery and lineage.
    The course is designed to be practical and hands-on, with plenty of opportunities to apply what you learn in
    the labs.
    Notice that this training does <b>not</b> cover the Microsoft 365 governance.
  </p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The training aims at people responsible for cloud and on-premise data governance using the Microsoft Purview platform. Notice that this training does <b>not</b> cover the Office 365 governance.
  </p>
  <h2>Course Outline</h2>

  <h4>What is Microsoft Purview?</h4>
  <p>This module introduces the basic features of Microsoft Purview.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The need for a metadata catalog</li>
    <li>Purview features</li>
    <li>The new Purview portal</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Setting up a Purview account</h4>
  <p>In this module students learn how to setup and configure an Microsoft Purview account</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating an account via the portal</li>
    <li>Inspecting the Purview account in the portal</li>
    <li>Purview cost</li>
    <li>LAB: Provision a Microsoft Purview account</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Microsoft Purview Portal and Collections</h4>
  <p>Microsoft Purview Portal is the web portal from which the Purview resources can be controlled and
    queried.
    Collections are the hierarchical grouping of sources, but they also provide the hierarchy of permissions
    that Purview users can have on the collected data.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Exploring the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal</li>
    <li>Creating Collection hierarchies</li>
    <li>Collection permissions</li>
    <li>LAB: Setup a collection hierarchy</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Registering Sources</h4>
  <p>
    A very important step in building a Purview solution is register all the sources that can be scanned.
    This module walks you through the different types of sources that can be registered as well as the registration
    process itself.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Supported sources</li>
    <li>Registering sources</li>
    <li>LAB: Registering sources in the Purview portal</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Scanning data</h4>
  <p>To automate the process of collecting and updating the meta-data stored in Purview, scans need to be scheduled.
    Scanning on-prem data requires an extra step of configuring a self-hosted integration runtime.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Setting up a scan</li>
    <li>Defining scan sets</li>
    <li>Scheduling a scan</li>
    <li>Using Azure Key Vault</li>
    <li>LAB: configuring data scan</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Scanning on-premises data</h4>
  <p>
    On-premises data sources require extra setup to scan them. They are normally shielded from Internet access by
    firewalls and other protection.
    So in order to scan them a self-hosted integration runtime needs to be setup.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integration runtimes</li>
    <li>Setup a self-hosted integration runtime</li>
    <li>Configure scans with a self-hosted integration runtime</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Query the Purview catalog</h4>
  <p>
    Once the Purview catalog has been setup and scanned the meta-data, business users as well as Azure Data Engineers
    want to be able to query the collected data, but with different tools.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Query from the portal</li>
    <li>Inspecting lineage information</li>
    <li>Integrating with Azure Data Factory</li>
    <li>Integrating with Azure Synapse</li>
    <li>LAB: Query the Purview catalog</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Working with Governance domains</h4>
  <p>To keep the governance effort manageable, the resources can be split up into Governance domains.
    Each of these can have their own access policies, glossary terms and data products.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating Governance domains</li>
    <li>Working with Governance domains</li>
    <li>Setup Data products</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Glossary and other relevant governance data</h4>
  <p>
    Not all important data for governance can be automatically extracted. This module goes into the process of manually
    enriching the scanned data
    with information only business users can provide. A business glossary is a first important piece of information: It
    defines the crucial concepts such as products, customers etc.
    But scanned resources can have additional properties as well, such as owners, experts etc. One can even define and
    add custom attributes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building glossaries</li>
    <li>Creating Term Templates</li>
    <li>Editing the catalog items</li>
    <li>Working with custom attributes</li>
    <li>LAB: enriching the Purview catalog</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Purview Health Management</h4>
  <p>After collecting and storing metadata in the Purview catalog, it is important to keep track
    of the health of the data. Health management contains built-in controls, on which tresholds can be set.
    Actions are offred to improve the data health were necessary.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Health Management</li>
    <li>Inspecting the Health Controls</li>
    <li>Configuring the Data Quality settings</li>
    <li>Inspecting the Actions and Health Reports</li>
  </ul>



  <h4>Controlling data access</h4>
  <p>
    When users consult the meta-data they often discover data sources to which they don't have access.
    To grant them permissions, Purview allows (for a limited set of sources) to grant these permissions from the Purview
    portal directly.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 types of granting data access</li>
    <li>Setup data access policies</li>
    <li>Configuring Self-service access policies</li>
    <li>Setup approval workflows</li>
    <li>LAB: Controlling data access</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Purview REST service</h4>
  <p>If you want to integrate Microsoft Purview in your custom application, you can use the REST interface to
    interact with Purview.
    But if you are not into REST coding, there are other techniques available as well, such as a command-line interface
    (CLI) and a PowerShell package
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Purview and Apache Atlas API</li>
    <li>Calling the API from PowerShell</li>
    <li>LAB: interacting with Microsoft Purview via REST API</li>
  </ul>
