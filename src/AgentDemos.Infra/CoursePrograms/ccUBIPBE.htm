  <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Power BI is a business analytics service that enables users to visualize and share insights from their data through interactive dashboards and reports. It allows you to connect to various data sources and create visually compelling reports that can be accessed across different devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    This course covers all important aspects of Power BI. You learn how to connect to any data source using Power Query. 
    The next step is enhancing the data model by using relationships, hierarchies, calculated columns, and measures. 
    When the model is finished, you will build an interactive report and maintain & share it in the Power BI Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are also interested in more technical topics like the Power Query language, the DAX language, 
    Power BI Gateways and Security, we recommend following our 5-day course <a href="/cc/ubipb">Analyzing your data with Power BI for
      BI Professionals</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Target audience</h2>
  <p>
    This course is intended for business users without any prior knowledge of Power BI. No technical or IT background is required.
