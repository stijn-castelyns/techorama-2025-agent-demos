    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
    <p>
        Generative AI models like GPT-4o from OpenAI are becoming 
        better and better at writing code. Modern developers who 
        embrace this new technology, can significantly speed up their 
        development tasks, going from implementing new features
        to writing documentation and unit tests. This course shows 
        how developers can harness the power of GenAI right from their 
        IDE by using GitHub Copilot.
    </p>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
        This course is meant for developers looking to
        increase their productivity using Generative AI
        through GitHub Copilot. All labs and demos are based
        on C# code, but the principles covered can be applied
        to any programming language.
    </p>
