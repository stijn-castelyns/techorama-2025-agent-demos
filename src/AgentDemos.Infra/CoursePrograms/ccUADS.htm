    <h2>Learning Goals </h2>
    <p>
        In many AI solutions pre-trained models (such as chat-GPT) are used. But in some cases, custom models trained
        on your corporate data is essential to make predictions within your business processes. This training focusses
        on the latter. First you will learn how to train models locally using Python. Then the focus shifts on how Azure
        Machine Learning provides extra features, such as scale out training, easy deployment and monitoring.
    </p>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
        This training aims at people with basic Python knowledge who want to start or further grow in a data science
        role.
        No machine learning knowledge is needed, but basic Python data manipulation skills are required to take the
        labs.
        If needed, attend our <a href="/cc/upde" target="_blank">Python for data engineering training</a> first.

    <h2>Course Outline</h2>

    <h4>Machine Learning Introduction</h4>
    <p>Before ML can be applied, the key concepts of machine learning need to be discussed.</p>

    <h4>Applying a machine learning methodology</h4>
    <p>When applying machine learning in an enterprise context, it's important to have a methodology to plan, document
        and execute the different steps in the machine learning proces.</p>

    <h4>Setup your Machine Learning environment</h4>
    <p>Before you can start developing machine learning solutions, you must first create an environment
        in which you can store and run your Python code. Both local and cloud solutions are presented.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Configuring your Environment</li>
        <li>Working with Python in Notebooks</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Prepare your data for Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>
        Like all data used for business intelligence, also data for machine learning should be cleansed. But machine
        learning
        data has some special requirements. This module shows how to use Python to prepare your data for machine
        learning.

    <h4>Build your own Machine Learning Model with scikit-learn</h4>
    <p>Many business problems can be tackled by basic machine learning techniques. In this module the most common
        machine learning approaches such as linear regression and random forests are used with Python. We also pay
        attention to model
        inspection.

        <li>Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines</li>
        <li>Model tuning: Working with Hyper-Parameters</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Azure Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>Machine learning on a local machine and a small dataset is one thing, running this on larger datasets or
        more CPU-hungry techniques (or even GPUs) can become a challenge. Another problem is deploying your model: How
        can we
        easily call the resulting model from within other applications? Azure Machine Learning helps
        answering these questions.</p>

    <h4>Automated Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>
        Part of the machine learning process can be automated. Azure Automated machine learning provides a web portal
        and a Python API
        to automate data preprocessing and model training.

    <h4>Microsoft Fabric Data Science</h4>
    <p>
        The Data Science experience in Microsoft Fabric provides notebooks, so all the previous Python code could be run
        in their. But Microsoft Fabric
        provides extra functionality as well: From pre-installed machine learning frameworks (SparkML, FLAML) to model
        management (MLFlow).

    <h4>Getting started with Keras for Deep Learning</h4>
    <p>From all the machine learning techniques there is one that gets popular for more challenging problems:
        Multiple layers of neural networks, better known as deep learning. For problems such as image recognition,
        speech understanding etc. this is currently the way to go. But it's from a mathematical point of view a
        very challenging technique. In this module the basics of deep learning are introduced.</p>
