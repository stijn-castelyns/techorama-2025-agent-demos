    <p>
        This module discusses considerations for implementing an ETL process, and then focuses on Microsoft SQL Server
        Integration Services (SSIS) as a platform for building ETL solutions.
    </p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h4>Debugging and Troubleshooting SSIS Packages</h4>
    <p>
        This module describes how you can debug packages to find the cause of errors that occur during execution. It
        then discusses the logging functionality built into SSIS that you can use to log events for troubleshooting
        purposes. Finally, the module describes common approaches for handling errors in control flow and data flow.

        Ensuring the high quality of data is essential if the results of data analysis are to be trusted. SQL Server
        includes Data Quality Services (DQS) to provide a computer-assisted process for cleansing data values, as well
        as identifying and removing duplicate data entities. This process reduces the workload of the data steward to a
        minimum while maintaining human interaction to ensure accurate results.

    <h4>Master Data Services</h4>
    <p>
        Master Data Services provides a way for organizations to standardize and improve the quality, consistency, and
        reliability of the data that guides key business decisions. This module introduces Master Data Services and
        explains the benefits of using it.

        <li>Using Custom Components in SSIS</li>
        <li>LAB: Using the Script task and Script component</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Deploying and Configuring SSIS Packages</h4>
    <p>
        Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) provides tools that make it easy to deploy packages to another
        computer. The deployment tools also manage any dependencies, such as configurations and files that the package
        needs. In this module, you will learn how to use these tools to install packages and their dependencies on a
        target computer.
