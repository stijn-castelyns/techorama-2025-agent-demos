    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
    <p>
        Power BI is a business analytics service that enables users to visualize and share insights from their data through interactive dashboards and reports. It allows you to connect to various data sources and create visually compelling reports that can be accessed across different devices.    </p>
    <p>
        This course will teach you all aspects of connecting to data sources and transforming data using Power Query, creating Power BI Semantic Models and reports, and publishing and maintaining them on the Power BI Service. The course also covers more technical topics on Power Query and DAX. Additionally, it explains how to configure a Data Gateway to connect the Power BI service to your on-premises data sources and how row-level security can be used to secure Semantic Models.
    </p>

    <h2>Target audience</h2>
    <p>
        This course is intended for BI or IT professionals who have a technical background. No prior knowledge of Power BI is required. 
        U2U also offers a 3-day course <a href="/cc/ubipbe">Analyzing your data with Power BI for Business Users</a> targeted at business users without a technical background.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Outline</h2>

      You will gain insights into enhancing a data model by constructing hierarchies within tables and assigning columns meaningful 
      names and appropriate data types. You will discover how to employ measures and calculated columns,
       thus enhancing your model. Additionally, the significance of establishing accurate relationships between tables will also be covered.

    <p>
        Participants will learn about the different types of relationships available in Power BI, including 1:N, 1:1 and N:M relationships.
        We will see the limitations of relationships, including the fact that there can only be one active relationship between two tables and how to overcome this
        limitation. Finally, we will discuss the concept of filter direction, and have a look at single- and cross filter directions.

    </ul>

    <h4>Semantic Models and Storage Modes</h4>
    <p>
        We will have a look at the different storage modes of a Power BI Semantic Model (Import, DirectQuery, Dual and Live). We will discuss a solution for the problem that in this era
        of big data, we often face data sources that are too big to be imported and too slow to be queried directly. The solution for this dilemma is a combination of Import and Direct Query, called aggregation tables.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Import Mode</li>
        <li>DirectQuery Mode</li>
        <li>Dual Mode</li>

    <h4>Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)</h4>
    <p>
        DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is the formula language used in Power BI Semantic Models, Excel Power Pivot Semantic Models, and in Analysis Services Tabular.
        Among other things, it's used to create calculated columns, measures and tables. In this chapter, we will introduce the basic concepts of DAX.
        If students are interested in a deeper dive into this language, we refer them to the three-day course <a href="/cc/udax">Mastering DAX</a>

    <h4>Managing Data Refresh in Power BI</h4>
    <p>
        Semantic Models that are uploaded to the Power BI Service need to have their data refreshed from time to time. This module shows
        the different options to configure the data refresh, for cloud data as well as data which is stored on-premises.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scheduling Semantic Model Refreshes</li>
