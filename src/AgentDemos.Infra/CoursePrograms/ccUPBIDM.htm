	<H2>Learning Goals</H2>

	<p>Data modeling is an essential step in Business Intelligence, when data is stored centrally to be used by multiple
		reports and analytical tools.
		This becomes an essential skill when building Power BI Data Flows, Power BI Data Sets, Analysis Tabular Models
		or
		other Analytical Data Storage Solutions on top of a Data Warehouse.
		In this training you will learn how to design such models according to the popular dimensional modeling
		techniques of Star Schemas.
	</p>

	<H2>Target Audience</H2>
	<P>This course is intended for Business Intelligence developers responsible for designing Power BI
		Data Models. The course assumes participants are already familiar with Power BI Desktop, and have
		some familiarity with DAX.
	</P>

	<H2>Course Outline</H2>
	<H4>The need for Data Modeling</H4>
	<p>
		When building a business intelligence solution, data has different modeling requirements than what is needed for
		operational applications.
		This module describes the challenges that can arise when storing data, and how good data models can overcome
		these.
		It presents the data model as an abstraction layer
		between the operational part and the analytical part of the corporate IT stack.

		<li>Advantages and Disadvantages of Normalizing Data</li>
		<li>Issues when Reporting on Operational Databases</li>
		<li>Differences between Data Warehouse, Data Flow, and Data Set</li>
		<li>Data Model Advantages</li>
		<li>Conducting User Interviews</li>

		<li>Documenting the Requirements</li>

	<H4>Modeling Dimensional Tables</H4>
	<p>Dimensional modeling is based on the idea of splitting data in the things that are (dimensions) and the things
		that happen (facts). This module describes the properties of dimension tables: Keys, attributes, hierarchies,
		... .</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Introducing Dimensional Modeling</li>
		<li>The Need for Dimension Tables</li>
		<li>Properties of Dimension Tables</li>
		<li>Surrogate Keys</li>
		<li>Star versus Snowflake Dimensions</li>
		<li>LAB: Building Dimensional Tables</li>
	</ul>

	<H4>Modeling Factual Tables</H4>
	<p>Dimensional modeling is based on the idea of splitting data in the things that are (dimensions) and the things
		that happen (facts). This module describes the most common types of fact tables</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Properties of Fact Tables</li>
		<li>Additive, Semi-Additive and Non-Additive Measures</li>
		<li>Transactional Fact Table</li>
		<li>Snapshot Fact Table</li>
		<li>Accumulating Snapshot Fact Table</li>
		<li>Inspecting the Size of the Fact Tables in Power BI</li>
		<li>LAB: Building Fact Tables</li>
	</ul>

	<H4>Designing the Date Dimension</H4>
	<p>Everybody wants to analyze over time, so this is the most common dimension in data models. Based on the
		principles introduced in the previous module a date dimension is built.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Why do we need a Date Dimension</li>
		<li>The Danger of the Auto-Generated Date Tables in Power BI</li>
		<li>Designing the date dimension</li>
		<li>Working with Time</li>
		<li>Multiple Time Zones</li>
		<li>Useful Tools and Scripts</li>
		<li>LAB: Building a Date Dimension in Power BI</li>
	</ul>

	<H4>Working with Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)</H4>
	<p>Since the dimension tables describe the things that are, they don't change as often as fact tables. Yet also
		properties of products, customers and other dimensions change over time as well. The different ways to register
		this in the data warehouse are discussed in this module.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Why do we need Slowly Changing Dimensions</li>
		<li>Type I, II and III Slowly Changing Dimensions</li>
		<li>Designing for SCD</li>
		<li>Advanced SCD Types</li>
		<li>LAB: Working with Slowly Changing Dimensions</li>
	</ul>

	<H4>Advanced Dimensional Modeling</H4>
	<p>
		The previous chapters covered the regular, most common scenario of modeling data. In this module some of the
		more special scenarios are covered, such as data arriving out of chronological order, parent-child relationships
		etc.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Early Arriving Facts</li>
		<li>Late Arriving Fcts</li>
		<li>Dealing with Currency Conversion</li>
		<li>Dealing with Hierarchies</li>
		<li>Role Playing Dimensions</li>
		<li>Modeling Many to Many Relations</li>
		<li>LAB: Advanced Dimensional Modeling</li>
	</ul>

	<H4>Physical Data Model Design</H4>
	<p>When implementing a data model in Power BI, a few choices
		need to be made regarding the physical implementation of the model. These are discussed in this module.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Staging Tables in Power Query</li>
		<li>Impact of Modeling on Model Size</li>
		<li>Data Flows</li>
		<li>Aggregation Tables</li>
		<li>LAB: Implementing a Dimensional Model</li>
