    <h4>Introduction to Power Apps</h4>
    <p>
        In the world of information workers, you will handle information that is stored across various software suites, such as SharePoint, Salesforce, Access databases and more.
        You would like your end-users to be able to browse and/or modify this data in a user-friendly and preferably mobile manner.
        Microsoft Power Apps enables you, without requiring any development skills, to create these user-friendly applications using your data.
        Once your design is complete, you can share your apps so others can utilize (and modify) them.
