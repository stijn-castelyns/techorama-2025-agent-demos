    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>

    <p>
        Machine Learning uses the data collected by organizations to build models which
        help in predicting future events. From analyzing sales opportunities up to predicting web server activity:
        Machine Learning
        is widely applicable. As the interest for machine learning is growing, the audience that wants to create such
        models is
        getting more varied. Business people with an interest in machine learning are known as citizen data scientists.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this two-day course the basic concepts of Machine Learning for citizen data science are introduced. A number
        of tools are introduced that can be used to create and deploy ML models without a lot of Machine Learning or
        coding knowledge in Microsoft Azure. Azure Machine Learning Service allows
        your models to
        be created automatically (Automated Machine Learning), or you can create your ML pipelines using a
        drag-n-drop approach (Designer). Cognitive Services are shown as well. These are AI services and
        cognitive
        APIs that you can easily use to build intelligent apps, without the need to have AI knowledge. Finally, you will
        have a look
        at the AI features that are available in Power BI, such as built-in AI visuals, and the possibility to use a ML
        model that you created in Azure Machine Learning or Cognitive services, in Power Query.
    </p>

    <p>
        Students will get an overview of the tools in Microsoft Azure that can help them creating Machine Learning
        Models
        without a lot of ML knowledge and without the need to code. They will learn about the basic concepts
        in Machine Learning.
    </p>



    <h2>Target Audience</h2>

    <p>
        This course is intended for people who plan on using machine learning without writing code. This can be BI
        developers as
        well as data analysts. Also project managers who which to get a better overview of Machine Learning
        possibilities in Azure
        can benefit from this course. Students should have a general background in working with data, and some
        experience
        with business intelligence in general.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Outline</h2>


    <h4>Introduction to Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>
        This classroom training does not require people to be familiar with Machine Learning. This introductory module
        makes sure
        all participants have a common ground for diving into the rest of the training by discussing the basic concepts
        of Machine
        Learning.

        <li>Why would we use Machine Learning?</li>
        <li>Machine Learning methodology</li>
        <li>Data preprocessing</li>
        <li>Modeling</li>
        <li>Model evaluation: measuring quality</li>
        <li>LAB: Machine Learning Quiz</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tools for citizen data scientists in Azure</h4>
    <p>
        In this introductory chapter we will start by illustrating what Machine Learning can do for a business, and how
        the cloud
        can be an ideal solution for Machine Learning. After that, we will shortly go over the different tools that are
        available
        for citizen data scientists to do Machine Learning in Microsoft Azure.

        <li>Coding approaches</li>
        <li>LAB: Azure tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cognitive Services</h4>
    <p>
        Business Intelligence for many years focused on turning data stored in structured, relational databases into
        insights or actionable information.
        There is however plenty of useful data that less easy to access such as plain text, images, phone recordings,
        ... . Cognitive services provides web services
        hosted in Microsoft Azure to convert these sources into an easier to analyze format (mostly json documents). In
        this chapter we will give an overview of the different
        cognitive services, where we will introduce the vision, speech, language, web search, and decision APIs. Some of
        these services are ready-made, whearas others are customizable.

    </ul>

    <h4>Azure Machine Learning Service: Automated ML</h4>
    <p>
        Azure Machine Learning Service is a service that helps to bring Machine Learning to the enterprise level, for
        example
        by offering tools that help with documentation, deployment, high availability and performance. This service
        contains tools
        for data scientists, as well as data citizens. One of the tools that may be especially useful for citizen data
        scientists is
        Automated ML, where Machine Learning is done in an automated way, with little time investment, programming
        skills or
        domain knowledge needed.

    </ul>

    <h4>Azure Machine Learning Service: Designer</h4>
    <p>
        A second service available in Azure Machine Learning Service is the Designer. This allows you to visually
        connect modules
        to create Machine Learning pipelines using a drag-n-drop approach. A module is an algorithm that you can perform
        on your data,
        such as a data transformation, training an algorithm, scoring new data, and validating a model.

    </ul>


    <h4>AI features in Power BI</h4>
    <p>
        Power BI is a very popular tool for visualizing data. Lately, more and more features have been added, that allow
        for some
        more advanced data analysis. Amongst others the Cognitive services and machine learning models created in the
        cloud can be consumed in Power BI Data Flows and Power Query.
