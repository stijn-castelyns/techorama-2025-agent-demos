    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>

    <p>
        Microsoft Copilot Studio allows you to create agents or bots through a no-code graphical interface without having to be an AI developer or data scientist. 
        Microsoft Copilot Studio lets you quickly create and publish agents to Microsoft 365 or any external site based on your own unique business needs. 
        This course gets you up and running with Microsoft Copilot Studio so you can quickly start building your own agents.
    </p>

    <h2>Target audience</h2>
    <p>
        This 3-day course is intended for people who want to build their own agent with Microsoft Copilot Studio. No prior knowledge is required.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Outline</h2>

    <h4>Introduction to the Microsoft Copilot Studio</h4>
    <p>
        Microsoft Copilot Studio empowers your teams to create agents or bots through a guided, no-code graphical interface. 
        This chapter provides an overview on how to get started with Microsoft Copilot Studio.

    </ul>

    <h4>Adding Knowledge Sources to an Agent</h4>
    <p>
        To provide your agent with an extensive range of knowledge, you can provide links to external Knowledge Sources. 
        Example Knowledge Sources are public Web Sites, SharePoint, Microsoft Graph, Dataverse and other enterprise data sources.  
        Configuring these Knowledge Sources will maximize the amount of data you agent has access to.

    <h4>Working with Topics</h4>
    <p>
        A topic is as a small individual conversation on a specific subject. An agent typically contains several topics, and these can be chained together to provide automated conversations. 
        In this chapter you will learn how to define your own topics using trigger phrases and conversational paths.

    </ul>
    
    <h4>Enhancing Agents with Actions</h4>
    <p>
        Actions allow you to extend the functionality of an agent so that it can interact with external services.
        You can use the prebuilt or custom Power Platform connectors as actions or use Power Automate to create an action from scratch.

    </ul>
    
    <h4>Enhancing Topics</h4>
    <p>
        Entities are informational units that represents a certain type of real-world subjects such as a city, phone number, postal code, city, or a person's name.
        The knowledge discovered by entities allows the agent to recognize the relevant information from user input and save it for later use.
        Power FX is a low-code language using which you can write complex logic to work with data and branching in agents.

    </ul>
    
    <h4>Building Autonomous Agents</h4>
    <p>
        Autonomous agents can automatically respond to signals across your business and initiate tasks. 
        They are configured to automatically react to events or triggers without human input that instead originate from various tools, systems, and databases, or are even scheduled to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
        Autonomous agents enable customers to move from legacy line of business applications to AI-first business processes.

        <li>Triggers and Power Automate Flow</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Publishing and Monitoring an Agent</h4>
    <p>
       Once your agent has been developed and tested, you can publish it to engage with your customers on multiple platforms or channels. 
       These include Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, websites, mobile apps, Facebook...
       Once published, Copilot Studio has a comprehensive set of analytics that show you the key performance indicators for your agent.
