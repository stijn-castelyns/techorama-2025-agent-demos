    <h4>Introduction to the Microsoft Power Platform</h4>
    <p>
        The Power Platform is a powerful combination of tools that allow you to build business applications to store, process and share your data.
        This chapter will show you how the Power Platform is built and gives you an overview of what is possible.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overview of the Microsoft Power Platform</li>
        <li>Overview of Power Apps</li>

    <h4>Overview of Model-Driven Apps/Dynamics 365</h4>
    <p>
        Before Model-Driven Apps can be created, an environment with a Microsoft Dataverse database must be provisioned. 
        This chapter introduces the concept of an environment and what role it plays in creating, managing and deploying Model-Driven Apps.
        Students are also provided with a quick overview of the look and feel that every Model-Driven App has and the common functionality of Model-Driven Apps.
    </p>

        <li>Navigating and Using a Model-Driven App</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Working with Solutions</h4>
    <p>
        Solutions are used by developers to package related customizations together so that they can be managed and deployed as a single unit. 
        We will see what components can be added to a solution and how they are the essential building blocks of your environment.

    <h4>Creating Model-Driven Apps</h4>
    <p>
        Model-Driven Apps are the building block of any business solution. For instance, we could create our own "event management" app.
        The app will group together everything our user needs from Microsoft Dataverse and the components we have built.

    <h4>Creating and Customizing Tables</h4>
    <p>
        Tables are used to model and store business data in Model-Driven Apps. Conceptually, they are similar to tables in a relational database.
Microsoft Dataverse provides several built-in tables, such as Contact and Account, but customizers will almost always need to create new tables.
In this chapter, you will learn all aspects of creating new tables.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h4>Managing Relationships</h4>
    <p>
        Just like accounts and contacts have relationships in Microsoft Dataverse, we can provide relationships for our own tables.
        You will learn what types of relationships are possible and how to configure them. 
    </p>
    <ul>
