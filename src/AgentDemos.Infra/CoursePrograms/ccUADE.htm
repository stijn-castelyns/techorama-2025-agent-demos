    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>

    <p>
        In this training the modern data warehouse approach to handling
        any volume of both cloud based as well as on-prem data is explained in detail.
        First students see how to setup an Azure
        Data Lake and inject data with Azure Data Factory. Then students learn how to cleanse the data and prepare it
        for analysis with Azure Synapse Analytics.
        The Lambda architecture (with focus on both batch data as well as a speed layer where live events are processed)
        is discussed as well, where the speed layer
        gets implemented with Azure Data Explorer.
        In the end, participants have hands-on experience with the most common Azure services to load, store and process
        data in the cloud.
    </p>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>This course focusses on developers and administrators who are considering migrating existing
        data solutions to the Microsoft Azure cloud. Some familiarity with relational database
        systems such as SQL Server is handy. Prior knowledge of Azure is not required.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Outline</h2>


    <h4>The Modern Data Warehouse</h4>

    <p>
      	The cloud requires to reconsider some of the choices made for on-premisses data handling. This module
		introduces the concept of a data lake and the data lakehouse. It also introduces the different services in Azure
		that can be used for data processing, and compares them to the
		traditional on-premisses data stack. Finally, it provides a brief intro in Azure and the use of the Azure
		portal.

    <h4>Storing Data in Azure</h4>

    <p>
        This module discusses the different types of storage available in Azure Storage as well as data
        lake storage. Also some of the tools to load and manage files in Azure storage and Data lake storage are
        covered.

    </ul>

    <h4>Introducing Azure Data Factory</h4>

    <p>
        When the data is stored and analyzed on-premises you typically use ETL tools such as SQL Server Integration Services for this. 
        But what if the data is stored in the Azure cloud? Then you can use Azure Data Factory, the cloud-based ETL service. 
        First we need to get used to the terminology, then we can start creating the proper objects in the portal.

    </ul>


    <h4>Authoring Pipelines in Azure Data Factory</h4>

    <p>
        This module dives into the process of building a Data Factory pipeline from scratch. The most common activities
        are illustrated. The module also focusses on how
        to work with variables and parameters to make the pipelines more dynamic.

    <h4>Creating Data Flows in Data Factory</h4>

    <p>With Data flows data can be transformed without the need to learn about another tool (such as Databricks or
        Spark). Both Data flows as well as
        the Power Query activity are covered.

    </ul>

    <h4>Managing Pipelines</h4>
	<p>
		Pipelines need an integration runtime to control where the code executes. This module provides an overview of the 3
		types of Integration Runtimes: Azure, self-hosted runtimes and SSIS. 
		It also discusses the different type of Triggers that exist and how they can be used to schedule pipelines.

	</ul>

    <h4>Azure SQL Database</h4>
    <p>
        An easy way to create a business intelligence solution in the cloud is by taking SQL Server -- familiar to
        many Microsoft
        BI developers -- and run it in the cloud. Backup and high availability happen automatically, and we can use
        nearly
        all the skills and tools we used on a local SQL Server on this cloud based solution as well.
    </p>

        <li>Provisioning an Azure SQL Database</li>
        <li>Migrating an on-premises Data Warehouse to Azure SQL Database</li>
        <li>Ingesting Azure Blob Storage data</li>
        <li>Working with Columnstore Indexes</li>
        <li>LAB: Using Azure SQL Databases</li>
    </ul>

	<h4>Using the Serverless SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics</h4>
	<p>
		Once data has been loaded into the data lake, the next step is to cleanse the data, pre-aggregate the data and
		perform other steps to make the data accessible to reporting and analytical tools.
		Dependant on the transformations required and the skills of the data engineer, the SQL dialect common to the
		Microsoft data stack (T-SQL) could play an important role.

		This module first introduces the scenarios where the move from an Azure SQL Database into Synapse databases
		could be useful, introduces briefly the two different types of SQL databases, and then focusses more deeply on
		the Synapse Analytics Serverless databases.
	</p>

		<li>Provisioned versus Serverless Synapse Analytics databases</li>
		<li>Creating and accessing Serverless databases</li>
		<li>Using OPENROWSET for data access</li>
		<li>Creating external tables</li>
		<li>LAB: Querying data via Azure Synapse Analytics Serverless databases</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Using Azure Provisioned SQL Pools</h4>
	<p>
		Since Serverless SQL Pools don't store data in a proprietary format, they lack features such as indexes, update
		statements etc. This is where
		Provisioned (or dedicated) SQL Pools in Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly known as Azure Data
		Warehouse) can come to the rescue.

		<li>Setting up table distributions</li>
		<li>Indexing</li>
		<li>LAB: Loading and querying data in Provisioned SQL Pools</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Getting Started with Spark</h4>
	<p>
		Although SQL is a very powerful language to access and manipulate data, it has its limitations. Complex data
		wrangling, advanced statistics or machine learning are ill-suited tasks for SQL.
		For this purpose Apache Spark is better suited. It's a divide-and-conquer framework for data access, transformation and
		querying which relies on programming languages such as Python and Scala.

		<li>Getting started with Notebooks</li>
		<li>Using the SparkContext</li>
		<li>LAB: Getting started with Spark and Notebooks</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Accessing Data in Synapse Analytics Spark</h4>
	<p>
		Apache Spark doesn't have a proprietary data storage option, but consumes and produces regular files stored in Azure
		Storage. This module covers how to access and manipulate data stored in the Synapse Analytics data lake or other
		Azure storage locations from Synapse Analytics Spark.

	</ul>

	<h4>Introducing Delta Lake</h4>
	<p>
		Delta Lake is an optimized storage layer that provides the foundation for storing data and tables in a Lakehouse Platform. Delta lake
		is an open source platform that extends Parquet files with ACID transactions and metadata handling. 
		This chapter provides an introduction to Delta Lake and how it can be used to create a Lakehouse architecture.

		<li>Creating Delta Tables</li>
		<li>Modifying data in a Delta Table</li>
		<li>Time Travel with Delta Tables</li>
		<li>Creating a Lake Database/Lakehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics</li>
		<li>Querying a Lake Database/Lakehouse using the Serverless SQL Pool</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Azure Data Explorer</h4>
	<p>
		In between large volumes of historical, long lived data stored in a data lake,
		and streams of short living events processed with Azure Stream Analytics, lives the challenge of
		working with large volumes of semi-structured telemetry and log data, where the analysis can have a
		longer latency that with event processing, but requires more historical information than what event processing
		technology can handle.
		For this kind of data processing Azure Data Explorer is the ideal tool

		<li>Accessing Data Explorer from Data Factory and Power BI</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>The Role of the Power BI Service</h4>
	<p>
		The Power BI Service (or the Analysis Services engine directly) plays an important role in the modern data
		warehouse solution. This module describes briefly the Power BI Service architecture and how it integrates with
		Azure Synapse Analytics.
