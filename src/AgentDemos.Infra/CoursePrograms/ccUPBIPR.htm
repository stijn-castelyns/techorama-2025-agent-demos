    <h2>
        Learning Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
        Power BI Paginated Reports are an alternative way to build reports. Although they are less interactive than regular Power BI reports, 
        they are more convenient to build reports that need to be printed, or exported to a wide variety of formats.
        In this course you will learn how to create new paginated reports with the Power BI Report Builder tool, using both semantic models as well as embedded data sources.
        Also the deployment of reports to the Power BI services is covered, as well as migration from SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to Power BI Paginated Reports.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Target Audience
    </h2>
    <p>
        This course is intended for people who need to create paginated reports in Power BI. Students should be familiar with the Power BI Service (portal, workspaces, semantic models).
    </p>

    <h4>
        Introduction to Power BI Paginated Reports
    </h4>
    <p>
        In this module you will get a birds eye view of the capabilities of Power BI Paginated Reports.

    <h4>
        Working with Power BI Report Builder
    </h4>
    <p>
       The browser based editor for paginated reports is very basic. Luckily there is a way more powerful tool: The Power BI Report Builder.
       In this module you learn how to install and use this tool.

    <h4>
        Bring Data in your Reports
    </h4>
    <p>
        Paginated reports can use the semantic models that regular Power BI reports use as well. 
        But they also support embedded data sets, which are specific to a particular paginated report.
        In this module you learn to setup these datasets, and learn to build parameterized reports.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connecting to Semantic Models</li>
        <li>Using Power Query to setup embedded Data Sets</li>
        <li>Using Parameters and Filters</li>
        <li>Using Parameter Lists</li>
        <li>Multi-select Parameters</li>
        <li>Lookup Functions</li>
        <li>LAB: Fetching Data and build a filtered Report</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        Advanced Report Components
    </h4>
    <p>
        Often users want to interact with a report, e.g. drill down in more detailed data, link one report to another, sort data
        interactively or create a table of content. All these kinds of features are discussed in this module on report enhancements.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive Navigation (drill-through)</li>
        <li>Displaying Data with collapsible Regions</li>
        <li>Interactive Column sorting</li>
        <li>Creating a Table of Contents with Document Maps</li>
        <li>TextBoxes and Placeholders</li>
        <li>Recursive Parents</li>
        <li>TABLe, LIst and matrIX combined: Tablix</li>
        <li>Repeating Visuals in a List</li>
        <li>Using Subreports</li>
        <li>LAB: Complex Report Components</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        Adding Charts to your Reports
    </h4>
    <p>
        Our brain is still wired to recognize trends in data more rapidly from a graphical representation than from an endless list
        of numbers. That's why charts, maps and other data visualizations are so popular. In this module you will learn all about these charts, and how to 
        even combine text and charts in a single table or matrix!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using Charts</li>
        <li>Advanced Charting and Sparklines</li>
        <li>Plotting Data on Maps</li>
        <li>Visualizing KPIs with indicators and Gauges</li>
        <li>Specifying Chart Colors with Palettes</li>
        <li>LAB: Charting Components</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Deployment and Migration</h4>
    <p>Once the report has been tested, it can be either saved locally, or be deployed to the Power BI Service. 
        This module also covers the scenario where your company was building SQL Server Reporting Services in the past, and wants to migrate
        these to Power BI Paginated Reports.
    </p>
<ul>
    <li>Publish a Paginated Report to the Power BI Service</li>
    <li>Uploading .rdl Files in a Power BI Workspace</li>
    <li>Migrating from SQL Server Reporting Services to Power BI</li>
</ul>
