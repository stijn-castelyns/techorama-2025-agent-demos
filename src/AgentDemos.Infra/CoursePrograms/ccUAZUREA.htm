    </p>
    <h2>Course Outline</h2>
    <h4>Azure Overview</h4>
    <p>
        Azure can really benefit your business by providing access to resources in the cloud and reducing costs at the same time. 
		Azure provides high availability, backup and SLAs for your cloud-based infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Azure Management Tools</h4>
		<p>
		Azure can be managed with a variety of different tools. For basic tasks, the Azure portal can be used.
        To automate the deployment of a big part of your infrastructure, scripting and command line tools are available as well. 
        You can use both PowerShell and the Azure CLI to manage your entire environment.</p>

	</ul>
    <h4>
        Azure Authoring Solutions
    </h4>
    <p>Another method to deploy resources in Azure is by using a declarative approach. Here, you define the 
        required components in a file, which is then deployed to the system. Azure Resource Manager will make 
        sure that the correct resources are created on the platform.
    </p>

        <li>LAB: Azure Authoring Solutions</li>
    </ul>
	<h4>
        Azure Role Based Access Control</h4>
		<p>
		Controlling access to resources is very important. With Azure's fine-grained permission model you have everything you need to assign the required permissions to the people who need them.</p>

		<li>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</li>
		<li>Role Assignments</li>
		<li>Role Definitions</li>
		<li>Create Custom Azure Role Definitions</li>

	</ul>
    <h4>Azure Storage</h4>
    <p>
        An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. 
		Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, massively scalable, and accessible 
		from anywhere in the world over HTTPS.

    </ul>
    <h4>Azure Networking</h4>
    <p>
        Virtual Networks in Azure allow you to setup communication between your VMs. Virtual Networks can be connected to one another through VNet peering.</p>
        Once VNets are connected, you will be responsible for successful name resolution. Azure DNS can be used to provide
        name resolution both internally and on the internet.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Azure Virtual Machines</h4>
    <p>
        With virtual machines you have access to a scalable computing infrastructure on demand when you quickly need to 
		create new environments to fulfill the growing needs of your organization. 
		Azure provides a set of predefined Windows and Linux operating systems in different configurations to get you started.
		You can also upload your own VHDs and start from there.

    </ul>
	<h4>
        Azure Advanced Networking</h4>
		<p>
		To control your network traffic flow, you can implement user defined routes. Protecting access to your resources
		can be accomplished by enabling endpoints or implementing a Firewall.</p>
	<ul>
        <li>User Defined Networking</li>
		<li>Service Endpoints</li>
		<li>Private Endpoints</li>
		<li>Azure Firewall</li>
		<li>LAB: Azure Advanced Networking</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Azure Hybrid Networking
    </h4>
    <p>Companies can decide to connect their on-prem network to Azure. A VPN Gateway can be deployed to connect to your on-prem network, using a site-to-site or point-to-site tunnel.
		If you need dedicated bandwidth, you can choose an ExpressRoute connection, giving your company a direct, private link to the Azure Datacenters.</p>
        For larger deployments, you can work with Azure Virtual WAN, a resource that allows you to manage all connections
        to your Azure VNet from a single interface.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Virtual Network Gateway</li>
        <li>Site-to-Site Connections</li>
        <li>Point-to-Site Connections</li>
        <li>ExpressRoute</li>
        <li>Azure Virtual WAN</li>

        <li>LAB: Azure Hybrid Networking</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Azure Load Balancing</h4>
    <p>
        Microsoft Azure provides multiple services to distribute and load balance network traffic. 
		You can use these services individually or combine the methods, depending on your needs, to build the optimal solution.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Azure Load Balancer</li>
        <li>Application Gateway</li>
        <li>Web Application Firewall</li>
        <li>Traffic Manager</li>

		<li>Comparing Load Balancing Solutions</li>
		<li>LAB: Azure Load Balancing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Manage Azure VMs</h4>
		<p>
		VMs in Azure are controlled and managed by you. That means that you will be responsible for backup, update management and business continuity. 
		Azure does provide services to help you accomplish these tasks.</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Disk Management</li>
        <li>Windows Admin Center</li>
        <li>VM Extensions</li>
		<li>VM Backup</li>

    </ul>
	<h4>
        Sizing and Troubleshooting Azure VMs</h4>
		<p>
		Troubleshooting VMs in the cloud can be difficult, especially if something goes wrong early in the boot process.
		Azure offers some solutions to assist you in this process.</p>
		To improve the performance of your applications, you can implement Virtual Machine Scale Sets. A scale set contains one or more VMs that host the same application.
		Additional VMs can be started manually or automatically based on resource usage.</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Boot Diagnostics</li>
        <li>Serial Console</li>
		<li>RDP Connection Issues</li>
		<li>Run Command</li>
		<li>Azure Mobile App</li>
		<li>VM Scale Sets</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Azure Web Apps</h4>
    <p>
        With Azure Web Apps you can deploy and scale modern websites and web apps in seconds.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>App Services and App Service Plans</li>
        <li>Web Apps</li>

    <h4>Azure SQL Database</h4>
    <p>
        Azure SQL Database delivers Database-as-a-Service functionality, based on SQL Server and hosted in Microsoft Azure.
		SQL Azure focuses on predictable performance, scalability, business continuity, data protection, zero administration, and familiar tools.

    <h4>Azure Governance</h4>
    <p>
        IT Governance ensures that your organization is able to achieve its goals through an effective and efficient use of IT. 
		It does this by creating clarity between your business goals and IT projects.
		Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign and, manage policies. 
		These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, to make sure those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards 
		and service level agreements.
